### I. Core Features of ArkUI Framework
1. Declarative Syntax  
○ Replaces imperative code with natural and intuitive UI description syntax, allowing developers to focus on UI presentation logic rather than interface updates.  
2. Cross-Platform Collaboration and Efficient Rendering  
○ Supports one-time development for multi-terminal deployment (e.g., phones, tablets, vehicle systems). Fine-grained UI update binding via compile-time optimization enhances layout rendering performance.  
3. Multi-Dimensional State Management  
○ Provides a flexible state management mechanism, supporting state sharing and responsive updates between components.



### II. Classification and Typical Examples of ArkUI Components
1. Basic Interactive Components  
● Button  
Triggers operations, supporting custom text, types (normal/capsule), click effects, and event binding (e.g., form submission, link navigation).  ● TextInput  
Receives user text input, supporting placeholders, input types (password/email), and input content validation.  ● Slider  
Slider component, allowing configuration of minimum/maximum values, step sizes, and sliding callbacks.  
2. Layout Container Components  
● Linear Layout  
○ Row: Horizontally arranges child components, sets spacing via `space`, and controls alignment with `alignItems`.  
○ Column: Vertically arranges child components, supporting scrolling for超长 content (adaptive extension).  ● Flex Layout  
Child components can be compressed/stretched to dynamically adapt to container space, suitable for complex adaptive interfaces.  ● Grid Layout (GridRow/GridCol)  
Defines row and column ratios via `rowsTemplate` and `columnsTemplate`, supporting cell layouts that span rows and columns.  ● Stack Layout (Stack)  
Child components are stacked in sequence, often used for pop-ups, floating buttons, and other overlay effects.  
3. Data Display Components  
● List  
High-performance list container supporting vertical/horizontal scrolling, displaying structured data via ListItem or grouping (ListItemGroup).  ● Grid  
Grid layout suitable for interfaces requiring uniform space allocation, such as calculators and photo albums.  ● Swiper  
Carousel component supporting loop playback of advertisements or image preview scenarios.  
4. Media and Graphics Components  
● Image  
Supports various image sources (local, network, Base64), configurable scaling modes (objectFit), rounded corners, and loading events (onComplete/onError).  ● Video  
Video playback component integrating decoding and playback control functions.  ● Canvas  
Provides 2D drawing capabilities, supporting custom graphics, text, and animations.  
5. Auxiliary Function Components  
● Popup  
Pop-up component supporting custom content (e.g., confirmation boxes, menus) with configurable animation effects.  ● Divider  
Divider component for distinguishing content blocks.  ● Badge  
Badge component supporting top-right/left/right markers for unread messages or status indicators.



### III. Advanced Layout Capabilities of ArkUI
1. Relative Layout (RelativeContainer)  
Flexibly controls the relative positions of child components via anchor rules (AlignRules), avoiding excessive nesting.  
2. Media Query (@ohos.mediaquery)  
Dynamically adjusts layouts based on device attributes (screen size, orientation) to achieve responsive design.  
3. Adaptive Scaling and Extension  
○ Uses percentage or `fr` units to proportionally adjust component sizes.  
○ Handles content overflow in conjunction with scroll containers (e.g., Scroll).



### IV. New Capabilities and Cross-Platform Support
1. Enhanced One-Many Components  
○ Column components support multi-terminal adaptation, and lists gain sticky top/bottom capabilities.  
2. ArkUI-X Extension  
Reuses code across platforms like Android/iOS, maintaining UI consistency and reducing multi-terminal development costs.



### Summary
ArkUI covers full-scenario requirements from basic interactions to complex data display through its rich component library and flexible layout system. Developers can efficiently build high-performance, cross-device HarmonyOS applications by combining declarative syntax with state management.
